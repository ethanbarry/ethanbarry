## Hello!

I'm a Mathematics & CS double major at The University of Texas at Tyler interested in numerical analysis, formal methods, and high-performance, low-level, high-reliability computing. I also like language design, compiler construction, and formalization of grammars and syntax.

I recently accepted a six-month full-time co-op with Trane Technologies' Residential Division, where I'll be writing controls software and learning all the things we *aren't* taught in our CS classes! I'm very excited for the opportunity!

I'm looking to spend my free time learning from and contributing
to some of my favorite open-source projects. Please drop me a message here
on GitHub if you have tips or suggestions!

### Things I Like
- The Rust programming language.
- The UNIX shell and UNIX philosophy.
- Self-hosted services.
- Great-looking UI.
- Thorough and complete documentation!
- Muh coffee!

#### Some Classes I'm Taking Next Fall Semester
- **MATH 3425:** *Foundations of Mathematics*
- **MATH 2415:** *Multivariate Calculus*

#### Some Cool Classes I've Taken
- **MATH 2413:** *Calculus I*
- **HNRS 2414:** *Honors Calculus II*
- **COSC 4327:** *UNIX Shell Programming*
- **COSC 4336:** *Software Development—we wrote a chess engine!*
- **COSC 4364:** *Cyber Risk Analysis*
- **COSC 4340/5340:** *Comparative Study of Programming Languages*
- **ART  4345/5345:** *Renaissance Art History (Italian Focus)*

### Personal Website:
I have a blog at [howdytx.technology](https://howdytx.technology) where I write about anything in CS or math that interests me.
