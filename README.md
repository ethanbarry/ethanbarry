## Hello!

I'm a CS student in East Texas interested in Android development, native UI
toolkits, Rust and memory safety, Linux system administration, as well as a happy user of the Plasma DE.

I'm looking to spend my free time learning from and maybe even contributing
to some of my favorite open-source projects. Please drop me a message here
on GitHub if you have tips or suggestions!

### Things I Like
- The Rust, Java, & Kotlin programming languages.
- Self-hosted services.
- Great-looking UI.
- Thorough and complete documentation!
- Muh coffee!
